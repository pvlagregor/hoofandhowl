This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Pushing Changes to the Website

The site is hosted on Vercel and deploys automatically when changes are pushed to the `main` branch on GitHub.

### Steps

1. **Make your changes** and verify them locally with `npm run dev`.
2. **Build to check for errors:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
3. **Stage and commit your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add <files>
   git commit -m "describe your changes"
   ```
4. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

Vercel will automatically pick up the push and deploy the updated site. You can monitor the deploy status in the [Vercel dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard).

### Branch Previews

If you push to a branch other than `main`, Vercel creates a preview deployment with its own URL so you can review changes before merging.

```bash
git checkout -b my-feature
# make changes
git push origin my-feature
```

Merge the branch into `main` (via GitHub PR or locally) to deploy to production.
